# Overview
This is a project under [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about). 

# Description 
This [web application](https://f00lg0ldl0af.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/) allows the user to draw anything from the imagination (like Leonardo Da Vinci).  

The user can choose:
1. Paint color
2. Paint mode (single or rainbow)
    * The user can only be in one of these two modes
    * Single mode - draws using only the color chosen in 1.
    * Rainbow mode - draws in random colors 
3. Size of the drawing area
4. Clear and start drawing anew 
5. Save the drawing as a PNG file
